# Pig Game

A game for two players. The game starts when the active player (PLAYER 1) rolls a dice by clicking the button ROLL DICE. The rolled number is added to active player’s current score of the current round (CURRENT). Player can choose to roll a dice again or to hold the score (by clicking the button HOLD). Each new rolled number is added to the current score. When player holds the score, the score of the current round is added to player’s total score. And the game switches to the next player (PLAYER 2). Now player number two can roll a dice or hold a score whenever he wants.
Whenever one of the players rolls a one on the dice, he loses his current score and it is the next player’s turn. First player to reach total score of 50 points, wins the game. When one of the players clicks NEW GAME, the game is restarted.
